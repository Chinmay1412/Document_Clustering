Cricket World Cup
This article is about the main tournament. For the
women’s tournament, see Women’s Cricket World Cup.
For the ongoing tournament, see 2015 Cricket World
Cup.
The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The
event is organised by the sport’s governing body, the
International Cricket Council (ICC), with preliminary
qualiﬁcation rounds leading up to a ﬁnals tournament held
every four years. The tournament is one of the world’s
most viewed sporting events and is considered the “ﬂagship event of the international cricket calendar” by the
ICC.[1]
The ﬁrst World Cup was organised in England in June
1975, with the ﬁrst ODI cricket match having been played
only four years prior. However, a separate Women’s
Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the
ﬁrst men’s tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912,
when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played
between Australia, England and South Africa. Each of
the ﬁrst three World Cups were held in England. From
the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared
between countries under an unoﬃcial rotation system,
with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one
match in the tournament.
The ﬁnals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full
members of the ICC (all of which are Testplaying teams)
and a number of teams made up from associate and aﬃliate members of the ICC, selected via the World Cricket
League and a later qualifying tournament. A total of 20
teams have competed in the ten editions of the tournament, with 14 competing in the 2015 tournament. Australia has won the tournament four times, with the West
Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once
each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a nonfullmember team came when Kenya
made the semiﬁnals of the 2003 tournament.
1 History
Main article: History of the Cricket World Cup
1.1 Before the ﬁrst Cricket World Cup
The ﬁrst ever international cricket match was played
between Canada and the United States, on 24 and
25 September 1844.[2] However, the ﬁrst credited
Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and
England, and the two teams competed regularly for The
Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to
Test status in 1889.[3] Representative cricket teams were
selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the
1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France
to win the gold medal.[4] This was the only appearance of
cricket at the Summer Olympics.
The ﬁrst multilateral competition at international level
was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Testplaying
nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa.
The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play diﬃcult on damp uncovered
pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a “surfeit of cricket”.[5] In subsequent years, international Test
cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a
multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[6]
The number of nations playing Test cricket increased
gradually over the years, with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and
Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four
or ﬁve days.
In the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began
playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted
for one day. Starting in 1962 with a fourteam knockout
competition known as the Midlands KnockOut Cup,[7]
and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963,
oneday cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The ﬁrst OneDay International match was played on the ﬁfth day of a
rainaborted Test match between England and Australia
at Melbourne in 1971, to ﬁll the time available and as
compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over
game with eight balls per over.[8]
In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival
World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced
many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches
played at night under ﬂoodlights with a white ball and
1

dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, eﬀects microphones to capture sounds
from the players on the pitch, and onscreen graphics.
The ﬁrst of the matches with coloured uniforms was the
WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on
17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic oneday competitions in England and other parts
of the world, as well as the early OneDay Internationals,
prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World
Cup.[9]
1.2 Prudential World Cups (1975–1983)
The Prudential Cup trophy
The inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by
England, the only nation able to put forward the resources
to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975
tournament started on 7 June.[10] The ﬁrst three events
were held in England and oﬃcially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches
consisted of 60 sixball overs per team, played during
the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing
cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[11]
Eight teams participated in the ﬁrst tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the
West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East
Africa.[12] One notable omission was South Africa, who
were banned from international cricket due to apartheid.
The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the ﬁnal at Lord’s.[12]
The 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC
Trophy competition to select nonTest playing teams
for the World Cup,[13] with Sri Lanka and Canada
qualifying.[14] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England
by 92 runs in the ﬁnal. At a meeting which followed the
World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed
to make the competition a quadrennial event.[14]
The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a
Testplaying nation, and Zimbabwe qualiﬁed through the
ICC Trophy. A ﬁelding circle was introduced, 30 yards
(27 m) away from the stumps. Four ﬁeldsmen needed to
be inside it at all times.[15] The teams faced each other
twice, before moving into the knockouts. India, an outsider quoted at 66–1 to win by bookmakers before the
competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the ﬁnal.[9][16]
1.3 1987–1996
India and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament,
the ﬁrst time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs
per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter
daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with
England’s summer.[17] Australia won the championship
by defeating England by 7 runs in the ﬁnal, the closest
margin in World Cup ﬁnal history.[18][19]
The 1992World Cup, held in Australia and NewZealand,
introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured
clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to
the ﬁelding restriction rules. The South African cricket
team participated in the event for the ﬁrst time, following
the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[20] Pakistan overcame a dismal start
in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs
in the ﬁnal and emerge as winners.[21]
The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as
host for some of its group stage matches.[22] In the semiﬁnal, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over
India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets
while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded
victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest
against the Indian performance.[23] Sri Lanka went on to
win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by
seven wickets in the ﬁnal at Lahore.[24]
1.4 Australian treble (19992007)
In 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some
matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and
theNetherlands.[25][26] Twelve teams contested theWorld
1.6 2015 3
Cup. Australia qualiﬁed for the semiﬁnals after reaching
their target in their Super 6match against South Africa oﬀ
the ﬁnal over of the match.[27] They then proceeded to the
ﬁnal with a tied match in the semiﬁnal also against South
Africa where a mixup between South African batsmen
Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his
bat and stranded midpitch to be run out. In the ﬁnal,
Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached
the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in
hand.[28]
A large crowd of over 10,000 fans welcome the Australian team
on completing the ﬁrst World Cup hattrick – Martin Place, Sydney.
South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003
World Cup. The number of teams participating in the
event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others – and
a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play
in Kenya because of security concerns – enabled Kenya
to reach the semiﬁnals, the best result by an associate.
In the ﬁnal, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two
wickets, the largest ever total in a ﬁnal, defeating India by
125 runs.[29][30]
In 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies
and expanded to sixteen teams.[31] Following Pakistan’s
upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group
stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in
his hotel room.[32] Jamaican police had initially launched
a murder investigation into Woolmer’s death but later
conﬁrmed that he died of heart failure.[33] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the ﬁnal by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in
the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight
championships.[34]
1.5 2011
India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh jointly hosted the 2011
Cricket World Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan
cricket team, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[35] The
number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped
down to fourteen.[36] Australia lost their ﬁnal group stage
match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[37] India won their second World
Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the ﬁnal in
Mumbai, and became the ﬁrst country to win the ﬁnal on
home soil.[36]
1.6 2015
Australia and New Zealand are jointly hosting the 2015
Cricket World Cup. The number of teams participating remained at fourteen with Ireland being the best performing nonfullmember with a total of 3 wins. The
two cohosts made it to the Quarter Finals along with
theWest Indies, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Pakistan,
and Bangladesh. Both the cohosts moved up to the SemiFinals along with India and South Africa. MS Dhoni led
India to the 2nd largest win steak, for a total of 11 wins,
in Cricket World Cup history thanks to India’s seven consecutive victories in the 2015 World Cup.
2 Format
2.1 Qualiﬁcation
Main article: Cricket World Cup qualiﬁcation
The Testplaying nations qualify automatically for the
World Cup main event, while the other teams have to
qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. The One Day International playing nations automatically enter the ﬁnal qualiﬁcation tournament, the
World Cup Qualiﬁer, along with other nations who have
qualiﬁed through separate competitions.
Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the second
World Cup, where two of the eight places in the ﬁnals
were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy.[13]
The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy
has varied throughout the years; currently, six teams are
selected for the Cricket World Cup. The World Cricket
League (administered by the International Cricket Council) is the qualiﬁcation system provided to allow the
Associate and Aﬃliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name “ICC Trophy” has been
changed to “ICC World Cup Qualiﬁer”.[38]
Under the current qualifying process, the World Cricket
League, all 91 Associate and Aﬃliate members of the
ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and
Aﬃliate members must play between two and ﬁve stages
in the ICCWorld Cricket League to qualify for theWorld
Cup ﬁnals, depending on the Division in which they start
the qualifying process.

2.2 Tournament

formats of ﬁnal tournament
The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed
The captains of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.
greatly over the course of its history. Each of the ﬁrst
four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into
two groups of four.[39] The competition consisted of two
stages, a group stage and a knockout stage. The four
teams in each group played each other in the roundrobin
group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semiﬁnals. The winners of the semiﬁnals
played against each other in the ﬁnal. With South Africa
returning in the ﬁfth tournament in 1992 as a result of
the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each
other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semiﬁnals.[40] The tournament was further
expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[41] The
top four teams from each group progressed to quarterﬁnals and semiﬁnals.
A new format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World
Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top
three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[42] The
Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced
from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against
other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[42] The top
four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semiﬁnals, with the winners playing in the ﬁnal.
The format used in the 2007World Cup features 16 teams
allocated into four groups of four.[43] Within each group,
the teams play each other in a roundrobin format. Teams
earn points for wins and halfpoints for ties. The top
two teams from each group move forward to the Super
8 round. The Super 8 teams play the other six teams
that progressed from the diﬀerent groups. Teams earned
points in the sameway as the group stage, but carried their
points forward from previous matches against the other
teams who qualiﬁed from the same group to the “Super
8” stage.[44] The top four teams from the Super 8 round
advance to the semiﬁnals, and the winners of the semiﬁnals play in the ﬁnal.
The format used in the 2011 and 2015[45] World Cups
features two groups of seven teams, each playing in a
roundrobin format. The top four teams from each group
proceed to the knock out stage consisting of quarterﬁnals, semiﬁnals and ultimately the ﬁnal.[46]
3 Trophy
Main article: Cricket World Cup Trophy
The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the
winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the ﬁrst permanent prize in the tournament’s history. Prior to this,
diﬀerent trophies were made for eachWorld Cup.[47] The
trophy was designed and produced in London by a team
of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two
months.
The current trophy is made from silver and gild, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The
columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three
fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and
ﬁelding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[48]
The seam is tilted to symbolize the Axial tilt of the Earth.
It stands 60 centimetres high and weighs approximately
11 kilograms. The names of the previous winners are
5
engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original
trophy. A replica diﬀering only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[49]
4 Media coverage
Mello, the mascot of the 2007 World Cup
The tournament is the world’s third largest[50] (with only
the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics exceeding it), with the 2011 Cricket World Cup ﬁnal
televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2 billion television viewers.[51][52][53] Television rights, mainly for the
2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1
billion,[54] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500 million.[55] The 2003 Cricket World Cup
matches were attended by 626,845 people,[56] while
the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672,000
tickets.[57][58]
Successive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as OneDay International cricket
has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in
South Africa was the ﬁrst to sport a mascot, Dazzler the
zebra.[59] An orange mongoose known as Mello was the
mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[60] Stumpy, a
blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011World Cup.[61]
On 13 February the opening of the 2015 tournament was
celebrated with a Google Doodle.[62]

The International Cricket Council’s executive committee
votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the
bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World
Cup.[63]
England hosted the ﬁrst three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the ﬁrst tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[10] India volunteered to host
the third CricketWorld Cup, but most ICCmembers preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England
in June meant that a match could be completed in one
day.[64] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India
and Pakistan, the ﬁrst hosted outside England.[65]
Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South
Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia in 1992 and
2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007.

7 Results
Map of each nation’s best results
Twenty nations have qualiﬁed for the Cricket World
Cup at least once (excluding qualiﬁcation tournaments).
Seven teams have competed in every ﬁnals tournament,
ﬁve of which have won the title.[9] The West Indies won
the ﬁrst two tournaments, Australia has won four, India
has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each
won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have
won consecutive titles.[9] Australia has played in six of
the ten ﬁnal matches (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003,
2007). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has
been runnersup three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The
best result by a nonTest playing nation is the semiﬁnal
appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the
best result by a nonTest playing team on their debut is
the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.[9]
Sri Lanka as a cohost of the 1996CricketWorld Cupwas
the ﬁrst host to win the tournament, though the ﬁnal was
held in Pakistan.[9] India won in 2011 as host and was the
ﬁrst team to win in a ﬁnal played in their own country.[66]
England is the only other host to have made the ﬁnal, in
1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled
their best World Cup results while cohosting the tournament are New Zealand as semiﬁnalists in 1992; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya as
semiﬁnalists in 2003.[9] In 1987, cohosts India and Pakistan both reached the semiﬁnals, but were eliminated by
Australia and England respectively.[9] Australia in 1992,
England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh
in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in
the ﬁrst round.
