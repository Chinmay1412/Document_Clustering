FIFA
This article is about the international association football
organisation. For the video games, see FIFA (video
game series).
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA /ˈfiːfə/; English: International Federation
of Association Football) is the international governing
body of association football, futsal and beach soccer.
FIFA is responsible for the organization of football’s major international tournaments, notably the World Cup
which commenced in 1930 and the Women’s World Cup
which commenced in 1991.
FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich,
membership now comprises 209 national associations.
Member countries must each also be members of one of
the six regional confederations into which the world is
divided: Africa, Asia, Europe, North & Central America
and the Caribbean, Oceania and South America.
Although FIFA does not control the rules of football, it
is responsible for both the organisation of a number of
tournaments and their promotion, which generate revenue
from sponsorship. In 2013, FIFA had revenues of over
1.3 billion U.S. dollars, for a net proﬁt of 72 million, and
had cash reserves over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.[3]
Reports by investigative journalists have linked the FIFA
leadership with rapaciousness, corruption, and bribery,
and alleged that vote rigging was involved in the election of president Sepp Blatter. FIFA’s choice to award
the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively, have been widely criticised, with allegations
of vote buying.
1 History
Main article: History of FIFA
The need for a single body to oversee association football became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international ﬁxtures. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques at the Rue Saint Honoré 229 in Paris on 21
May 1904.[4] The French name and acronym persist even
outside Frenchspeaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark,
France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by Madrid
Football Club; the Spanish federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland. Also, that same day,
the German Association declared its intention of aﬃliating through a telegram.[1]
The ﬁrst president of FIFA was Robert Guérin. Guérin
was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from
England, by then a member of the association. The ﬁrst
tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding
principles of FIFA.
Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the
application of South Africa in 1908, Argentina and Chile
in 1912, and Canada and the United States in 1913.
During World War I, with many players sent oﬀ to war
and the possibility of travel for international ﬁxtures
severely limited, the organisation’s survival was in doubt.
Postwar, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved
from extinction, but at the cost of the withdrawal of the
Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an
unwillingness to participate in international competitions
with their recentWorldWar enemies. The Home Nations
later resumed their membership.
The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum in England.

2 2 STRUCTURE
2.1 Legal and by laws
FIFA is an association established under the Laws of
Switzerland. Its headquarters are in Zurich.
FIFA’s supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each aﬃliated member association. The Congress has met 66 times since
1904; it now assembles in ordinary session once every
year and, additionally, extraordinary sessions have been
held once a year since 1998. At the congress, decisions are made relating to FIFA’s governing statutes and
their method of implementation and application. Only
the Congress can pass changes to FIFA’s statutes. The
congress approves the annual report, and decides on the
acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its General
Secretary, and the other members of FIFA’s Executive
Committee on the year following the FIFAWorld Cup.[5]
Each national football association has one vote, regardless
of its size or footballing strength.
The President and General Secretary are the main ofﬁceholders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat, with
its staﬀ of approximately 280 members. FIFA’s Executive Committee, chaired by the President, is the main
decisionmaking body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. FIFA’s worldwide organisational structure also consists of several other bodies, under authority
of the Executive Committee or created by Congress as
standing committees. Among those bodies are the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the
Referees Committee.
2.2 Administrative cost
FIFA publishes its results according to IFRS. The total
compensation for the management committee in 2011
was 30 million for 35 persons. Blatter, the only fulltime person on the committee, earns approximately two
million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary and the rest
in bonuses.[6][7][8] A report in London’s Sunday Times in
June 2014 said the members of the committee had their
salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the
year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the
committeemembers following the 2010 FIFAWorld Cup
in South Africa.[9]
2.3 6 confederations and 209 national associations
Besides its worldwide institutions (presidency, Executive
Committee, Congress, etc.) there are six confederations
recognised by FIFA which oversee the game in the diﬀerent continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA’s statutes, and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.
AFC – Asian Football Confederation
Australia has been a
member of the AFC
since 2006
CAF – Confederation of African Football
CONCACAF – Confederation of North,
Central American and Caribbean Association

French Guiana, Guyana
and Suriname are CONCACAF members
although they are in
South America. The
French Guiana team is a
member of CONCACAF
but not of FIFA.

OFC – Oceania Football Confederation
UEFA – Union of European Football
Associations
Teams representing the
transcontinental nations
of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Russia and Turkey are
UEFA members, although the majority of
their territory is outside
of continental Europe.
Israel is also member
of UEFA. Monaco and
the Vatican City are not
members of UEFA or
FIFA, while Gibraltar is
only a member of UEFA.
In total, FIFA recognises 209 national associations and
their associated men’s national teams as well as 129
women’s national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. FIFA has
more member states than the UN, as FIFA recognises 23
nonsovereign entities as distinct nations, such as the four
Home Nations within the United Kingdom and politically
disputed territories such as Palestine.[10]
The FIFAWorking Committee on Small Nations has categorized potential FIFA members into three categories:
1. Independent states not in FIFA (Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Palau, Tuvalu)
4.1 Discipline of national associations 3
2. Nonindependent territories (Guadeloupe,
Greenland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Martinique,
Northern Mariana Islands, Réunion, Sint Maarten,
Zanzibar)
3. Politically sensitive areas (Catalonia, Gibraltar,
North Ossetia, Kosovo, Northern Cyprus).[11][12]
The FIFAWorld Rankings are updated monthly and rank
each team based on their performance in international
competitions, qualiﬁers, and friendly matches. There is
also a world ranking for women’s football, updated four
times a year.
3 Recognitions and awards
FIFA awards, each year, the title of FIFA Ballon d'Or to
the top men’s and women’s players of the year, as part of
its annual awards ceremony which also recognises team
and international association football achievements. Until 2009, they awarded the FIFA Player of the Year to
the best player, until it and the Ballon d'Or ceased to be
awarded. At the Ballon d'Or banquet, the FIFA Puskás
Award, the FIFA/FIFPro Best XI, FIFA Fair Play Award,
and the FIFA Presidential Award are also awarded.
In 1994 FIFA published the FIFA World Cup AllTime
Team. In 2000 FIFA published the results of an Internet poll, declaring Real Madrid to be the FIFA Club of
the Century. In 2002 FIFA announced the FIFA Dream
Team, an alltime allstar team chosen by fans in a poll.
As part of its centennial celebrations in 2004, FIFA organised a “Match of the Century” between France and
Brazil.
4 Governance and game development
Main article: Laws of the Game (association football)
The laws that govern football, known oﬃcially as
the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the
International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA
has members on its board (four representatives); the
other four are provided by the football associations of
the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882
and are recognised for the creation and history of the
game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed
by at least six of the eight delegates.
FIFA commits itself to constantly improving the sport of
football. The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA’s governing system. The governing
system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances.
FIFA headquarters
It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing
and adhoc committees.[13]
4.1 Discipline of national associations
FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the
sport and developing the game around the world. One
of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government
interferes in the running of FIFA’s associate member organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly.
A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a
maximum of three clubs, and appear in oﬃcial matches
for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to
30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case
of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result
of this controversy, FIFA modiﬁed this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with
outofphase seasons.
5 Anthem
Main article: FIFA Anthem
Since the 1994 FIFAWorld Cup, like the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed
by the German composer Franz Lambert. It has been recently rearranged and produced by Rob May and Simon
Hill. The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of
oﬃcial FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such
as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA
Women’s World Cup, FIFA U20 World Cup, FIFA U17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA
U20 Women’s World Cup, FIFA Women’s U17 World
Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World
Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[15]
Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast
partners to use short sequences including the anthem at
4 7 CORRUPTION AND LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE
The ﬂag of FIFA,[14] used since June 2009
the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well
as for break bumpers, to help promote FIFA’s sponsors.
This emulates practices long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA Champions
League. Exceptions may be made for speciﬁc events; for
example, an original piece of African music was used for
bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

7 Corruption and legislative interference
In May 2006 British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings' book Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, VoteRigging and Ticket Scandals (Harper Collins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged
international cashforcontracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA’s marketing partner ISL, and revealed how
some football oﬃcials have been urged to secretly repay
the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that
voterigging had occurred in the ﬁght for Sepp Blatter’s
continued control of FIFA.
Shortly after the release of Foul! a BBC television exposé
by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke for the BBC
news programme Panorama was broadcast. In this hourlong programme, screened on 11 June 2006, Jennings and
the Panorama team agree that Sepp Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to
repay more than £1m worth of bribes pocketed by football oﬃcials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the
English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that “behaves like a maﬁa family”, highlighting
the association’s “decadeslong traditions of bribes, bungs
and corruption.”[22]
All testimonies oﬀered in the Panorama exposé were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both,
save one; Mel Brennan, formerly a lecturer at Towson
University in the United States (and from 2001 to 2003
Head of Special Projects for CONCACAF, a liaison to
the eFIFA project and a 2002 FIFA World Cup delegate), became the ﬁrst highlevel football insider to go
public with substantial allegations of greed, corruption,
nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA
leadership. During the Panorama exposé, Brennan—
the highestlevel AfricanAmerican in the history of
world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at
CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at
FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of
bribery and corruption and opaque action by FIFA in late
2010,[23] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA, with Brennan calling directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the
sport throughout the world.[24]
In a further Panorama documentary broadcast on BBC
One on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three
senior FIFA oﬃcials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and
Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by FIFA’s
marketing partner International Sports Leisure (ISL) between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes
paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. A former ISL
executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that
the company was only awarded the marketing contract
for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA ofﬁcials. The programme also alleged that another current
oﬃcial, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that
FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had
not been told about it via 'oﬃcial channels’.
The programme also criticized FIFA for allegedly requiringWorld Cup host bidding nations to agree to implement
special laws for the World Cup, including blanket tax exemption for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation of workers’ rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations
are required to keep the details of the required laws conﬁdential during the bidding process; but that they were revealed by the Dutch government, which refused to agree
to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that
its bid could be adversely aﬀected. According to the programme, following Jennings’ earlier investigations he was
banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he
says have not been made clear; and the accused oﬃcials
7.2 2011 FIFA presidential election 5
failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.
British Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson,
head of England’s World Cup bid, criticized the timing
of the broadcast, three days before FIFA’s decision on
the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, on the grounds
that it might damage England’s bid; the voters included
oﬃcials accused by the programme.[25][26]
In June 2011, it came to light that the IOC had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president João
Havelange into claims of bribery. The BBC Panorama
programme alleged that the Brazilian accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from International Sports Leisure
(ISL). The Olympic governing body said “the IOC takes
all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would
always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any
IOCmembers to be passed to our ethics commission”.[27]
Dave Zirin said greed, corruption, nonfeasance and
malfeasance are endemic to FIFA leadership, and that
FIFA should be abolished for the good of the game. He
said that currently FIFA is in charge of both monitoring
corruption in soccer matches, and marketing and selling
the sport, but that two separate organizational bodies are
needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption
and matchﬁxing and the like, and an organization that’s
responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling
the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that’s responsible for both seems highly ineﬀective
and detrimental to the sport.[28]
7.1 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids
Further information: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup
bids
Further information: Garcia Report
FIFA’s choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia
and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticised by media.[29][30][31][32][33] It has been alleged that
some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members
were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before
the result was announced.[34] SeppBlatter was widely criticised in the media for giving a warning about the “evils
of the media” in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of
the 2018 World Cup, a reference to The Sunday Times
exposés[35] and the Panorama investigation.[36]
Two members of FIFA’s executive committee were
banned from all footballrelated activity in November
2010 for allegedly oﬀering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British
parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 ﬁnals was told by member of parliament,
Damian Collins, that there was evidence from the Sunday Times newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and
Jacques Anouma of Côte d'Ivoire were paid by Qatar.
Qatar have categorically denied the allegations, as have
Hayatou and Anouma.[37]
FIFA President Blatter said, as of 23 May 2011, that
British newspaper The Sunday Times has agreed to bring
its whistleblowing source to meet senior FIFA oﬃcials,
who will decide whether to order a new investigation into
alleged World Cup bidding corruption. "[The Sunday
Times] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this
whistleblower here to Zurich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this,” Blatter said.
Speciﬁcally, the whistleblower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques
Anouma were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar.[38][39]
The emirate’s bid beat the United States in a ﬁnal round of
voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening
the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged
taking the matter “step by step.” The FIFA president said
his organization is “anxiously awaiting” more evidence
before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations
made in Britain’s parliament in early May 2011.
Hayatou, who is fromCameroon, leads the Confederation
of African Football and is a FIFA vice president.
Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The
whistleblower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African
voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was
later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court
ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times
reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistleblower would meet with FIFA secretary general, Jerome Valcke, and legal director, Marco
Villiger.
Allegations against FIFA oﬃcials have also been made
to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England’s bid and the English Football
Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four
longstanding FIFA executive committee members—
JackWarner, Nicolas Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira andWorawi
Makudi—engaged in “improper and unethical” conduct
in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six
FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.[40]
7.2 2011 FIFA presidential election
FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened
the investigation to examine the conduct of four
oﬃcials—Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner,
along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) oﬃcials
Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester—in relation to
claims made by executive committee member, Chuck
Blazer.[41][42][43] Blazer, who is the general secretary of
the CONCACAF federation, has alleged that violations
were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during
a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on
10 and 11 May—the same time Lord Triesman had ac6 8 VIDEO REPLAY
cused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup
2018 vote—in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential
election,[44] in which Bin Hammam, who also played a
key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly oﬀered ﬁnancial incentives for votes cast in his
favour during the presidential election. As a result of
the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were
suspended.[45] Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter’s conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, Jerome Valcke, had told him via email
that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.[46][47] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had
“used its ﬁnancial muscle to lobby for support.” Qatar ofﬁcials denied any impropriety.[48] Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment
in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA
administration.[49]
Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30
May 2011, Fred Lunn, vicepresident of the Bahamas
Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in
cash[50] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential
candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11
June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese
Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000
in cash for “development projects” as an incentive to vote
for Bin Hammam.[51]
7.3 Response to allegations
After being reelected as President of FIFA Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform
FIFA inwake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan,
CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform.[52] Former US
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a
role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and
former Netherlands national football team player Johan
Cruyﬀ is also being linked with a role.[47][53]
UEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino said he hopes
for “concrete” measures to be taken by the world game’s
authority. Saying that “the UEFA executive committee
has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and
eﬀective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.”[54]
IOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation
by saying that he believes FIFA “can emerge stronger”
from its worst ever crisis, stating that “I will not point a
ﬁnger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger
and from within”.[55]
Several of FIFA’s partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including CocaCola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa.[56][57][58] CocaCola
raised concerns by saying “the current allegations being
raised are distressing and bad for the sport"; with Adidas saying “the negative tenor of the public debate around
Fifa at themoment is neither good for football nor for Fifa
and its partners"; moreover Emirates raised its concerns
by saying “we hope that these issues will be resolved as
soon as possible"; and Visa adding “the current situation
is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take
all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been
raised.”[56]
Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear
FIFA needed to change, saying “there is no doubt there
needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that
we're hearing worldwide”, with Australian Senator Nick
Xenophon accusing FIFA of “scamming” the country
out of the A$46 million (US$49 million) it spent on the
Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that “until
the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia
must hold oﬀ spending anymore taxpayers’ money on any
future World Cup bids.”[59]
Theo Zwanziger, President of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to reexamine the awarding
of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar.[60]
Transparency International, which had called on FIFA to
postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance
structure.[61]
Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego
Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption
scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs.
He said “Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who
do not want to relinquish power. It’s always going to be
the same.”[62] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the
organization, saying, “FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it
faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to
be transparent about what it is doing and what it ﬁnds, and
that its conduct in the future will be such that the public
can be conﬁdent in the governance of the sport.”[63]
8 Video replay
See also: Goalline technology
FIFA does not permit video evidence during matches,
although it is permitted for subsequent sanctions.[64]
The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board “agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slowmotion playback which reﬂected, or might reﬂect, adversely on any decision of the
referee”.[65] In 2008, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:
“Let it be as it is and let’s leave [football] with errors.
The television companies will have the right to say [the
referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes
the decision – a man, not a machine.”[66]
It has been said that instant replay is needed given the
diﬃculty of tracking the activities of 22 players on such a
9.2 Women’s tournaments 7
large ﬁeld,[67] and it has been proposed that instant replay
be used in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings
or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line,
since those events are more likely than others to be game
changing.[68]
Critics point out that instant replay is already in use in
other sports, including rugby union, cricket, American
football, Canadian football, basketball, baseball, tennis,
and ice hockey.[67][69][70][71] As one notable proponent of
video replay, Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz has been
quoted as saying that the “credibility of the game” is at
stake.[72]
An incident during a secondround game in the 2010
FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where
a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have
leveled the scores at 2–2 in a match that ultimately ended
in a 4–1 German victory, crossed the line but was not
seen to do so by the match oﬃcials, led FIFA oﬃcials
to declare that they will reexamine the use of goalline
technology.[73]
