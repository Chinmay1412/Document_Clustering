Football
This article is about the overall concept of games called
football. For speciﬁc versions of the game, the balls
themselves and other uses of the term, see Football (disambiguation).
Football refers to a number of sports that involve,

to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to
score a goal. Unqualiﬁed, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most
popular in the regional context in which the word appears: association football (also known as soccer) in the
United Kingdom and most of the nonEnglish speaking
world; gridiron football (speciﬁcally American football
or Canadian football) in the United States and Canada;
Australian rules football or rugby league in diﬀerent areas of Australia; Gaelic football in Ireland; and rugby
football (speciﬁcally rugby union) in New Zealand.[1][2]
These diﬀerent variations of football are known as football codes.
Various forms of football can be identiﬁed in history, often as popular peasant games. Contemporary codes of
football can be traced back to the codiﬁcation of these
games at English public schools in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries.[3][4] The inﬂuence and power of the
British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread
to areas of British inﬂuence outside of the directly controlled Empire,[5] though by the end of the nineteenth
century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
Gaelic Football, for example, deliberately incorporated
the rules of local traditional football games in order to
maintain their heritage.[6] In 1888, The Football League
was founded in England, becoming the ﬁrst of many
professional football competitions. During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew
to become among the most popular team sports in the
world.[7]
1 Common elements
The various codes of football share certain common elements. Players in American football, Canadian football,
rugby union and rugby league takeup positions in a limited area of the ﬁeld at the start of the game.[8] They tend
to use throwing and running as the main ways of moving
the ball, and only kick on certain limited occasions. Body
tackling is a major skill, and games typically involve short
passages of play of 5–90 seconds.[8] Association football,
Australian rules football and Gaelic football tend to use
kicking to move the ball around the pitch, with handling
more limited. Body tackles are less central to the game,
and players are freer to move around the ﬁeld (oﬀside laws
are typically less strict).[8]
Common rules among the sports include:
� Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players;
some variations that have fewer players (ﬁve or more
per team) are also popular.
� A clearly deﬁned area in which to play the game.
� Scoring goals or points, by moving the ball to an opposing team’s end of the ﬁeld and either into a goal
area, or over a line.
� Goals or points resulting from players putting the
ball between two goalposts.
� The goal or line being defended by the opposing
team.
� Players being required to move the ball—depending
on the code—by kicking, carrying, or handpassing
the ball.

2 3 EARLY HISTORY
� Players using only their body to move the ball.
In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[8] In most codes,
there are rules restricting themovement of players oﬀside,
and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under
or over a crossbar between the goalposts.
2 Etymology
Main article: Football (word)
There are conﬂicting explanations of the origin of the
word “football”. It is widely assumed that the word “football” (or “foot ball”) references the action of the foot
kicking a ball. There is an alternative explanation, which
is that football originally referred to a variety of games in
medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no
conclusive evidence for either explanation.
3 Early history
3.1 Ancient games
The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have
played many ball games, some of which involved the use
of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed
to have been adapted from a Greek team game known
as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[9][10] or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda),[11] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright,
Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the
Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.150c.215
AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[12][13][14][15][16] The Roman politician Cicero (106–
43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst
having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber’s
shop. Roman ball games already knew the airﬁlled ball,
the follis.[17][18] The Ancient Greek game of Episkyros
recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[19]
According to FIFA the competitive game cuju is the
earliest form of football for which there is scientiﬁc
evidence.[20] It occurs namely as an exercise in a military manual from the third and second centuries BC.[20]
Documented evidence of an activity resembling football
can be found in the Chinese military manual Zhan Guo
Ce compiled between the 3rd century and 1st century
BC.[21] It describes a practice known as cuju (��, literally
“kick ball”), which originally involved kicking a leather
ball through a small hole in a piece of silk cloth which was
ﬁxed on bamboo canes and hung about 9 m above ground.
During the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), cuju games
were standardized and rules were established. Variations
of this game later spread to Japan and Korea, known as
kemari and chukguk respectively. Later, another type of
goal posts emerged, consisting of just one goal post in the
middle of the ﬁeld.
The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (��), and was developed during the Asuka period. This is known to have
been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto
from about 600 AD. In kemari several people stand in a
circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the
ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie). The
game appears to have died out sometime before the mid19th century. It was revived in 1903 and is now played at
a number of festivals.
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient,
or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples
in many diﬀerent parts of the world. For example, in
1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form
of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.[22]
There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice,
called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick
the ball through each other team’s line and then at a
goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown,
Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans,
called Pahsaheman. On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuﬀed balls which have been generalised
by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for “game
ball”). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from
the 1878 book by Robert BroughSmyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas
is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he hadwitnessedAboriginal people playing the
game: “Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player
will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and
how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.”
Some historians have theorised thatMarn Grook was one
of the origins of Australian rules football.
The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Kiorahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular
ﬁeld divided into zones, and score points by touching the
'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or
target.
Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by
indigenous peoples are also welldocumented as existing
since before this time, but these had more similarities to
basketball or volleyball, and since their inﬂuence on modern football games is minimal, most do not class them as
football. Northeastern American Indians, especially the
Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use
of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however,
although a ballgoal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern
descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a
form of “football.”
These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football
codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

3.2 Medieval and early modern Europe
Further information: Medieval football
The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual
Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game
played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia
Brittonum, which describes “a party of boys ... playing
at ball”.[23] References to a ball game played in northern
France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball
was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[24] date from the
12th century.[25]
An illustration of socalled "mob football"
The early forms of football played in England, sometimes
referred to as "mob football", would be played between
neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited
number of players on opposing teams who would clash en
masse,[26] struggling to move an item, such as inﬂated animal’s bladder[27] to particular geographical points, such
as their opponents’ church, with play taking place in the
open space between neighbouring parishes.[28] The game
was played primarily during signiﬁcant religious festivals,
such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[27] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number
of English towns (see below).
The ﬁrst detailed description of what was almost certainly
football in England was given by William FitzStephen in
about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London
youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:
After lunch all the youth of the city go out into
the ﬁelds to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the
workers from each city craft are also carrying
their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy
citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth
vicariously: you can see their inner passions
aroused as they watch the action and get caught
up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.[29]
Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of “ball play” or “playing at ball”. This reinforces the
idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily
involve a ball being kicked.
An early reference to a ball game that was probably
football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland,
England: “Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against
David”.[30] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with
a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a “football game” at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named
William Bernard.[31] Another reference to a football
game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England:
"[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay
friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself”.[30]
In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City
of London issued a decree banning football in the French
used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the
city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de
grosses pelotes de pee][32] in the ﬁelds of the public from
which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.”
This is the earliest reference to football.
In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing
and cockﬁghting, or other such idle games”,[33] showing
that “football” — whatever its exact form in this case —
was being diﬀerentiated from games involving other parts
of the body, such as handball.
4 3 EARLY HISTORY
A game known as “football” was played in Scotland as
early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was
not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys
playing a “football” ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some
references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion
to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The
word “pass” in the most recent translation is derived from
“huc percute” (strike it here) and later “repercute pilam”
(strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of
the same team. The original word translated as “goal” is
“metum”, literally meaning the “pillar at each end of the
circus course” in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to “get hold of the ball before [another player] does”
(Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the
original 1930 translation “Throw yourself against him”
(Age, objice te illi).
France circa 1750
King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word “football”, in
1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for “foteball”.[30][34]
There is also an account in Latin from the end of
the 15th century of football being played at Cawston,
Nottinghamshire. This is the ﬁrst description of a “kicking game” and the ﬁrst description of dribbling: "[t]he
game at which they had met for common recreation is
called by some the football game. It is one in which
young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by
throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it
along the ground, and that not with their hands but with
their feet... kicking in opposite directions” The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating
that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game
had started.[30]
Other ﬁrsts in the mediæval and early modern eras:
� “a football”, in the sense of a ball rather than a game,
was ﬁrst mentioned in 1486.[34] This reference is in
Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans. It states:
“a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an
instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn
'pila pedalis’, a fotebal.”[30]
� a pair of football boots was ordered by King Henry
VIII of England in 1526.[35]
� women playing a form of football was ﬁrst described
in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems:
"[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes,
When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at
football playes.”[36]
� the ﬁrst references to goals are in the late 16th and
early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively,
John Norden and Richard Carew referred to “goals”
in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were
made: “they pitch two bushes in the ground, some
eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them,
ten or twelue [twelve] score oﬀ, other twayne in like
distance, which they terme their Goales”.[37] He is
also the ﬁrst to describe goalkeepers and passing of
the ball between players.
� the ﬁrst direct reference to scoring a goal is in John
Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): “I'll play a
gole at campball" (an extremely violent variety of
football, which was popular in East Anglia). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to
“when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in
squadrons forth they goe”.
3.3 Calcio Fiorentino

Main article: Calcio Fiorentino
In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the
period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game
which today is known as "calcio storico" (“historic kickball”) in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of
4.1 English public schools 5
the city would dress up in ﬁne silk costumes and embroil
themselves in a violent form of football. For example,
calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is
said to have originated as a military training exercise. In
1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wroteDiscorso
sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes
said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game.
The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was
revived in May 1930).
3.4 Oﬃcial disapproval and attempts to
ban football
Main article: Attempts to ban football games
There have been many attempts to ban football, from
the middle ages through to the modern day. The ﬁrst
such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed
by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and
1667.[38]:6 Football faced armed opposition in the 18th
Century when used as a cover for violent protest against
the enclosure act. Women were banned from playing at
English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a
ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers
still face similar problems in some parts of the world.
4 Establishment of modern codes
4.1 English public schools
Main article: English public school football games
While football continued to be played in various forms
throughout Britain, its public schools (known as private schools in other countries) are widely credited with
four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they
were important in taking football away from its “mob”
form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second,
many early descriptions of football and references to it
were recorded by people who had studied at these schools.
Third, it was teachers, students and former students from
these schools who ﬁrst codiﬁed football games, to enable
matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at
English public schools that the division between “kicking” and “running” (or “carrying”) games ﬁrst became
clear.
The earliest evidence that games resembling football were
being played at English public schools—mainly attended
by boys from the upper, uppermiddle and professional
classes — comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and
Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a
translation exercise with the phrase “We wyll playe with
a ball full of wynde”.[39]
Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the
early 16th century and later headmaster at other English
schools, has been described as “the greatest sixteenth
Century advocate of football”.[40] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football.
Mulcaster’s writings refer to teams (“sides” and “parties”), positions (“standings”), a referee (“judge over the
parties”) and a coach "(trayning maister)". Mulcaster’s
“footeball” had evolved from the disordered and violent
forms of traditional football:
[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not
meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie
their strength: nor shouldring or shuﬃng one
an other so barbarously ... may use footeball
for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use
of the legges.[41]
In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen,
mentioned elements of modern football games in a short
Latin textbook called Vocabula. Wedderburn refers to
what has been translated into modern English as “keeping
goal” and makes an allusion to passing the ball (“strike
it here”). There is a reference to “get hold of the ball”,
suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that
the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of
opposing players (“drive that man back”).
Amore detailed description of football is given in Francis
Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660.[42]
Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey’s Grammar
School, Sutton Coldﬁeld, is the ﬁrst to describe goals and
a distinct playing ﬁeld: “a close that has a gate at either
end. The gates are called Goals.” His book includes a
diagram illustrating a football ﬁeld. He also mentions
tactics (“leaving some of their best players to guard the
goal”); scoring (“they that can strike the ball through their
opponents’ goal ﬁrst win”) and the way teams were selected (“the players being equally divided according to
their strength and nimbleness”). He is the ﬁrst to describe
a “law” of football: “they must not strike [an opponent’s
leg] higher than the ball”.
English public schools were the ﬁrst to codify football
games. In particular, they devised the ﬁrst oﬀside rules,
during the late 18th century.[43] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were “oﬀ their side” if they
simply stood between the ball and the goal which was
their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball
forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, oﬀside laws began to diverge
and develop diﬀerently at each school, as is shown by the
rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and
Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[43] The ﬁrst
known codes— in the sense of a set of rules—were those
6 4 ESTABLISHMENT OF MODERN CODES
of Eton in 1815 [44] and Aldenham in 1825.[44])
During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over
twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the
inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the
time, many children were part of the labour force. Feast
day football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work,
became the inventors of organised football games with
formal codes of rules.
Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a
way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths
ﬁt. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely
between diﬀerent schools and were changed over time
with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought
developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a
game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby,
Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a
game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted
(as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse).
The division into these two camps was partly the result
of circumstances in which the games were played. For
example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had
restricted playing areas; the boys were conﬁned to playing
their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difﬁcult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.
Rugby School
William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to
have “with a ﬁne disregard for the rules of football, as
played in his time [emphasis added], ﬁrst took the ball
in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive
feature of the rugby game.” in 1823. This act is usually
said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is
little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking
the ball in his arms’ is often misinterpreted as 'picking the
ball up' as it is widely believed thatWebbEllis’ 'crime' was
handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling
the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases
compulsory,[45] the rule for whichWebb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time
only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.
The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s
meant that people were able to travel further and with less
inconvenience than they ever had before. Interschool
sporting competitions became possible. However, it was
diﬃcult for schools to play each other at football, as each
school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves,
one half played by the rules of the host “home” school,
and the other half by the visiting “away” school.
Themodern rules ofmany football codes were formulated
during the mid or late 19th century. This also applies
to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The
major impetus for this was the patenting of the world’s
ﬁrst lawnmower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing ﬁelds, pitches, grass courts,
etc.[46]
Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have
barely been played beyond the conﬁnes of each school’s
playing ﬁelds. However, many of them are still played at
the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school
games below).
Public schools’ dominance of sports in the UK began to
wane after the Factory Act of 1850, which signiﬁcantly
increased the recreation time available to working class
children. Before 1850, many British children had to work
six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From
1850, they could not work before 6 a.m. (7 a.m. in winter) or after 6 p.m. on weekdays (7 p.m. in winter);
on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2 p.m. These
changes mean that working class children had more time
for games, including various forms of football.
4.2 Firsts
4.2.1 Clubs
Main article: Oldest football clubs
Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the
18th century, for example London’s Gymnastic Society
which was founded in the mid18th century and ceased
playing matches in 1796.[47][48]
The ﬁrst documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called “The FootBall
Club” who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during
the period 1824–41.[49][50] The club forbade tripping but
allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the
ball.[50]
In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with
codifying the rules then being used at the school. These
were the ﬁrst set of written rules (or code) for any form of
football.[51] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby
game.
4.2 Firsts 7
4.2.2 Competitions
Main article: Oldest football competitions
One of the longest running football ﬁxture is the CordnerEggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar
School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since
1858. It is believed by many to also be the ﬁrst match
of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its ﬁrst year. The ﬁrst football
trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup,
donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne,
played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules.[52] The oldest
football league is a rugby football competition, the United
Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby
trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878. The
South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877)
is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan
Cup (1867) and the oldest national soccer competition is
the English FA Cup (1871). The Football League (1888)
is recognised as the longest running Association Football
league. The ﬁrst ever international football match took
place between sides representing England and Scotland
on March 5, 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the
FA. The ﬁrst Rugby international took place in 1871.
4.2.3 Modern balls
Main article: Football (ball)
In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal
bladders, more speciﬁcally pig’s bladders, which were
inﬂated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.[53] However, in 1851,
Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers
from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both
round and ovalshaped balls at the Great Exhibition in
London. Richard Lindon’s wife is said to have died of
lung disease caused by blowing up pig’s bladders.[54] Lindon also won medals for the invention of the “Rubber inﬂatable Bladder” and the “Brass Hand Pump”.
In 1855, the U.S. inventor Charles Goodyear — who had
patented vulcanized rubber — exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanized rubber panels, at the
Paris Exhibition Universelle. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.[55]
The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and
pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become
popular until the 1960s, and was ﬁrst used in the World
Cup in 1970.
4.2.4 Modern ball passing tactics
Main article: Passing (association football)
Richard Lindon (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the
ﬁrst footballs with rubber bladders.
The earliest reference to a game of football involving
players passing the ball and attempting to score past a
goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn,
a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland.[56] Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion
to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was
in a forward or backward direction or between members
of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)[57]
“Scientiﬁc” football is ﬁrst recorded in 1839 from
Lancashire[58] and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862[59] and from Sheﬃeld FC as early as
1865.[60][61] The ﬁrst side to play a passing combination
game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70[62][63] By
1869 they were “work[ing] well together”, “backing up”
and beneﬁting from “cooperation”.[64] By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: “Lieut. Creswell, who having
brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle
to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the
minute before time was called”[65] Passing was a regular
feature of their style[66] By early 1872 the Engineers were
the ﬁrst football team renowned for “play[ing] beautifully
together”[67] A double pass is ﬁrst reported from Derby
school against Nottingham Forest inMarch 1872, the ﬁrst
of which is irrefutably a short pass: “Mr Absey dribbling

4.3 Cambridge rules
Main article: Cambridge rules
In 1848, at Cambridge University, Mr. H. de Winton and
Mr. J.C. Thring, who were both formerly at Shrewsbury
School, called a meeting at Trinity College, Cambridge
with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby,
Winchester and Shrewsbury. An eighthour meeting produced what amounted to the ﬁrst set of modern rules,
known as the Cambridge rules. No copy of these rules
now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held
in the library of Shrewsbury School.[74] The rules clearly
favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed
when a player catches the ball directly from the foot entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive oﬀside rule, disallowing players from “loitering” around the
opponents’ goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely
adopted outside English public schools and universities
(but it was arguably the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
Football Association committee members responsible for
formulating the rules of Association football).
4.4 Sheﬃeld rules
Main article: Sheﬃeld rules
By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed
throughout the Englishspeaking world, to play various
codes of football. Sheﬃeld Football Club, founded
in 1857 in the English city of Sheﬃeld by Nathaniel
Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the
world’s oldest club playing association football.[75] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the
Sheﬃeld rules. The code was largely independent of the
public school rules, the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence being
the lack of an oﬀside rule.
The code was responsible for many innovations that later
spread to association football. These included free kicks,
corner kicks, handball, throwins and the crossbar.[76] By
the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north
and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule
changes by both the London and Sheﬃeld FAs gradually
eroded the diﬀerences between the two games until the
adoption of a common code in 1877.
4.5 Australian rules
Main article: Australian rules football
See also: Origins of Australian rules football
There is archival evidence of “football” games being
played in various parts of Australia throughout the ﬁrst
Tom Wills, widely regarded as the father of Australian football
half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised
game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital
city of Victoria.
In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australianborn cricketer
educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to
Bell’s Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a
“football club” with a “code of laws” to keep cricketers ﬁt
during winter.[77] This is considered by historians to be a
deﬁning moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was
able to coordinate football matches in Melbourne that
experimented with various rules,[78] the ﬁrst of which was
played on July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a
schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School
and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised
football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed
the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and
Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set
of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The
committee debated rules used in English public school
games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he
learnt during his schooling. The ﬁrst rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal ﬁgure in
Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted
“a game of our own”.[79] The code was distinctive in the

prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an oﬀside rule and that players were speciﬁcally penalised for
throwing the ball.
TheMelbourne football rules were widely distributed and
gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules
were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other inﬂuential Victorian football
clubs. A signiﬁcant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison’s committee accommodated the Geelong Football
Club's rules, making the game then known as “Victorian
Rules” increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon
adopted cricket ﬁelds and an oval ball, used specialised
goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball
while running and spectacular high marking. The game
spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside of
its heartland in southern Australia the code experienced
a signiﬁcant period of decline following World War I but
has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts
of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged
as the dominant professional competition.
4.6 Football Association
Main article: The Football Association
During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in
England to unify and reconcile the various public school
games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the
driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was
a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own
rules of what he called “The Simplest Game” (these are
also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October
1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules
was drawn up by a seven member committee representing
former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby,
Marlborough and Westminster.
At the Freemasons’ Tavern, Great Queen Street, London
on the evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of
several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area

met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a
single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game
among its members. Following the ﬁrst meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of
them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In
total, six meetings of the FA were held between October
and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set
of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the
fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules
diﬀered from the draft FA rules in two signiﬁcant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking
(kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:
IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the
ball towards his adversaries’ goal if he makes a
fair catch, or catches the ball on the ﬁrst bound;
but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark
he shall not run.
X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries’ goal, any player on the
opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold,
trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him,
but no player shall be held and hacked at the
same time.
—[80]
10 4 ESTABLISHMENT OF MODERN CODES
At the ﬁfth meeting it was proposed that these two rules
be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but
F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and
the ﬁrst FA treasurer, objected. He said: “hacking is the
true football”. However, the motion to ban running with
the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath
withdrew from the FA. After the ﬁnal meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "Laws of Football", the ﬁrst
comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as
Association Football. The term “soccer”, in use since
the late 19th century, derives from an abbreviation of
“Association”.[81]
The ﬁrst FA rules still contained elements that are no
longer part of association football, but which are still
recognisable in other games (such as Australian football
and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a
fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free
kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents’ goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal,
from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line.
4.7 Rugby football
Main article: History of rugby union
In Britain, by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playA rugby scrum in 1871
ing variations of the Rugby school game. There were
also “rugby” clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New
Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set
of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London
came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU).
The ﬁrst oﬃcial RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.
These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included
the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an
attempt at goal, though dropgoals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still themain form
of contest.
4.8 North American football codes
Main articles: History of American football and
Canadian football § History
As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century,
North American schools and universities played their own
local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire
played a game calledOld division football, a variant of the
association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[82] They
remained largely "mob football" style games, with huge
numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a
goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[83] The violence
of these mobstyle games led to widespread protests and
a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all
forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[83] In its place, two general types of
football evolved: “kicking” games and “running” (or “carrying”) games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "Boston
game", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the
ﬁrst formal football club in the United States, was formed
in 1862 by schoolboys who played the “Boston game”
on Boston Common.[83][84] The game began to return to
American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College
of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing
“kicking” games during this time. In 1867, Princeton
used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[83]
The “Tigers” of Hamilton, Ontario, circa 1906. Founded 1869
as the Hamilton Foot Ball Club, they eventually merged with the
Hamilton Flying Wildcats to form the Hamilton TigerCats, a
team still active in the Canadian Football League.[85]
In Canada, the ﬁrst documented football match was a
practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University
College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards
west of Queen’s Park). One of the participants in the
game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir)
William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.[86] In
1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one
of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules
based on rugby football.[86] A “running game”, resem4.9 Gaelic football 11
bling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal
Football Club in Canada in 1868.[87]
OnNovember 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game
that was played with a round ball and, like all early games,
used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as the ﬁrst
game of American intercollegiate football.[83][88]
Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal, and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugbybased rules used by McGill and
the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.[89][90][91] Within
a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill’s rules
and had persuaded other U.S. university teams to do the
same. On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at theMassasoit
Convention in Springﬁeld, Massachusetts, agreeing to
adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some
variations.[92]
Rutgers College Football Team, 1882
In 1880, Yale coachWalter Camp, who had become a ﬁxture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules
were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp’s two most important rule changes that
diverged the American game from rugby was replacing
the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the downanddistance rules.[92] American
football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even
death.[93] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to
hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging
them to make drastic changes.[94] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce
injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass.
Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be
one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[95]
Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an eﬀort to distinguish it from a more rugbyoriented game. In
1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the
Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage
and downanddistance system from American football,
among others.[96] Canadian football then implemented
the legal forward pass in 1929.[97] American and Canadian football remain diﬀerent codes, stemming from rule
changes that the American side of the border adopted but
the Canadian side has not.
4.9 Gaelic football
The AllIreland Football Final in Croke Park, 2004.
Main article: History of Gaelic football
In the mid19th century, various traditional football
games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry. One observer,
Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the “ﬁeld game” in which the object was
to put the ball through archlike goals, formed from the
boughs of two trees; and the epic “crosscountry game”
which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday
on which it was played, and was won by one team taking
the ball across a parish boundary. “Wrestling”, “holding”
opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.
By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started
to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College, Dublin
was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments
in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English
FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of
caid had begun to give way to a “roughandtumble game”
which allowed tripping.
There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish
varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic
Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought
to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to
reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The ﬁrst Gaelic football rules were drawn up by
Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on February 7, 1887. Davin’s rules showed the inﬂuence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise
a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of
this diﬀerentiation was the lack of an oﬀside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other
Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).
4.10 Schism in Rugby football
Further information: History of rugby league
12 4 ESTABLISHMENT OF MODERN CODES
An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in
rugby football which led to the formation of rugby league. The
caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an archopponent of
player payments, and James Miller, a longtime opponent of
Marshall. The caption reads: Marshall: “Oh, ﬁe, go away
naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t aﬀord to take a
holiday for football any day they like!" Miller: “Yes, that’s just
you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a
millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I
see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have
a share in the spending of it.”
The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was
founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in
the code. Professionalism was beginning to creep into
the various codes of football.
In England, by the 1890s, a longstanding Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in
northern England were working class and could not afford to take time oﬀ to train, travel, play and recover
from injuries. This was not very diﬀerent from what
had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very diﬀerently in the
RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in
Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a
player being paid broken time payments, which replaced
wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives
of the northern clubs met in Huddersﬁeld to form the
Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body
initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players
could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside
sport.
The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby
had to become a better “spectator” sport. Within a few
years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the
RFU, most notably with the abolition of the lineout.
This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with
the “playtheball ruck”, which allowed a twoplayer ruck
contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held,
being replaced by a playthe ballruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFUmerged
in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the ﬁrst
time the name rugby league was used oﬃcially in England.
Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which
remainedmembers of national federations aﬃliated to the
IRFB, became known as rugby union.
4.11 Globalisation of association football
Main article: History of FIFA
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th
century, with the increasing popularity of international
ﬁxtures. The English Football Association had chaired
many discussions on setting up an international body, but
was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France,
Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and
Switzerland, to form an international association. The
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)
was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. Its ﬁrst president
was Robert Guérin. The French name and acronym has
remained, even outside Frenchspeaking countries.
4.12 Further divergence of the two rugby
codes
Rugby league rules diverged signiﬁcantly from rugby
union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15
to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional
rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were
launched in Australia the following year. However, the
rules of professional games varied from one country to
another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to ﬁx the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at
the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League
International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting
in Bordeaux.
During the second half of 20th century, the rules changed
further. In 1966, rugby league oﬃcials borrowed the
American football concept of downs: a team was allowed
to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby
union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled
13
and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately). The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became
known as the six tackle rule.
With the advent of fulltime professionals in the early
1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the
ﬁve metre oﬀside distance between the two teams became 10metres, and the replacement rule was superseded
by various interchange rules, among other changes.
The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th
century, although less signiﬁcantly than those of rugby
league. In particular, goals from marks were abolished,
kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line
were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine
who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or
maul, and the lifting of players in lineouts was legalised.
In 1995, rugby union became an “open” game, that is one
which allowed professional players. Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared
— and despite the fact that oﬃcials from both forms of
rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility
of reuniﬁcation — the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is
unlikely in the foreseeable future.

5 Use of the word “football”
For more details on this topic, see Football (word).
The word "football", when used in reference to a speciﬁc game can mean any one of those described above.
Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred
over the term football, primarily because it is used in
diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent parts of the Englishspeaking
world. Most often, the word “football” is used to refer to
the code of football that is considered dominant within
a particular region. So, eﬀectively, what the word “football” means usually depends on where one says it.
Players assemble at the line of scrimmage in an American football game.
Association football is known generally as soccer where
other codes of football are dominant, including: the
United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
American football is always football in the United States.
In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more
popular, the Canadian code is known as football and association football is known as le soccer.[98] Of the 45 national FIFA aﬃliates in which English is an oﬃcial or
primary language, most currently use Football in their organizations’ oﬃcial names; the FIFA aﬃliates in Canada
and the United States use Soccer in their names. A
few FIFA aﬃliates have recently “normalized” to using
“Football”, including:
� Australia’s association football governing body
changed its name in 2005 from using “soccer” to
“football”[99]
� New Zealand’s governing body also changed in
2007, saying “the international game is called
football.”[100]
� Samoa changed from “Samoa Football (Soccer)
Federation” to "Football Federation Samoa" in
2009.[101][102]

[45] example of ball handling in early football from English
writer William Hone, writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the
social commentator Sir FrederickMorton Eden, regarding
“FootBall”, as played at Scone, Scotland:
The game was this: he who at any time got
the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till
overtaken by one of the opposite part; and
then, if he could shake himself loose from
those on the opposite side who seized him, he
run on; if not, he threw the ball from him,
unless it was wrested from him by the other
party, but no person was allowed to kick
it. (William Hone, 1825–26, The EveryDay
Book, “February 15.” Access date: March 15,

[54] The exact name of Mr Lindon is in dispute, as well as the
exact timing of the creation of the inﬂatable bladder. It is
known that he created this for both association and rugby
footballs. However, sites devoted to football indicate he
was known as HJ Lindon, who was actually Richards Lindon’s son, and created the ball in 1862 (ref: Soccer Ball
World), whereas rugby sites refer to him as Richard Lindon creating the ball in 1870 (ref: Guardian article). Both
agree that his wife died when inﬂating pig’s bladders. This
information originated from web sites which may be unreliable, and the answer may only be found in researching
books in central libraries.
