Project: Document Clustering, Feature aggregation & Visualization
Group Members: Chinmay Patel, Akshay Dharpale, Aarshvi Gajjar, Pulkit Agrawal
Abstract: 
This project provides document clustering, feature aggregation and visualization over a heterogeneous dataset. Document clustering is based on features such as TF-IDF, PoS, NER, length of document, document sentiment, type of media, source type etc. Visual summaries of the clusters is presented in the form of a stacked bar chart for PoS density, a heat map for co-occurrence matrix, word (tag) cloud for a cluster.
Project Scope:
Document clustering aims at helping practitioners to take decisions. The goal of a good document clustering scheme is to minimise intra-cluster distances between documents , while maximising inter-cluster distances. The outcome of the project would be relevant document clusters presented in visual form which would be human understandable thus helping data
analysts to take decisions. Here input will be corpus of documents crawled from the web, which can be html, text, pdf and other types.
Proposed System/Approach:
Initially the heterogeneous data set would be provided. This would be processed and converted into homogeneous form. Further this homogeneous data set would be clustered based on different relevant features. These document clusters would be presented in different visual form as per analysts requirement.The project would be version controlled using Git.The project would be implemented in Java language.
